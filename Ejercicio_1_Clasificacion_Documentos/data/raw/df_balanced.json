In most of this thread, I have\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\nwhat is not. \n\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\ndo this.  \n\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \n\n\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\npresence of qi.\n\n\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.

{"text":"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of\nmite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot\nof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years\n(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.","target":3}

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\nalternative health therapies.]\n\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\n  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in\n  highly variable colour patterns.\n\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\n\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\n  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\n\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\n  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\n  the actual object itself.\n\n  [...]\n\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\n\n\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\nconsumer's guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\nvNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for\nevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples\nof hokum.]\n\n  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of\n  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,\n  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous\n  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of\n  the unknown.\n","target":3}

Anyone who agrees with something \nI say can't be all bad.  ;-)\n\nSeriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  \nI still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science \nis mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your \ncontention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \"scientific\" \ncan possibly know what's true and what's not.  \n\n\nOkay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\nhasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can't be of any interest to us.\"  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There've got to\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia\/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia\/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia\/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don't have any way of \nknowing that it's effective.\"  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of \nbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I'm capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

{"text":"Okay, this is a long shot.\n\nMy friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very  \nregularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a  \nnumber of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have  \nsaid either \"You have mono\" or \"You're full of it; there's nothing wrong  \nwith you.\"  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her,  \nand one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome.\n\nNow, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  \nit exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the  \nstory?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be real?\n\nHas anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live  \nwith?  Thanks for your assistance.","target":3}

Dr. Noordewier has \nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \nto his current work in computational biology.\n\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\n\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \n National Laboratory) \n\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \ntechniques in this domain.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\n\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \nthe field.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\n\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \nof word-based analyses.\n\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\n\n               ISMB Conference, c\/o J.

There do not\nseem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The\nCopenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF\nstudies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,\nbut like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.\n\nFrom one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in\nthe absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From\nanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of\nthe specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,\ntherefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.\n\nWhether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling\nheadaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic\ncolleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients\nthey can get.

{"text":"Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

{"text":"I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\nSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \nMed. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \nno idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1\/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and\/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107","target":3}

{"text":"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\nI generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have\nany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\nto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \nlegs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\nI'm frequently in severe pain.\n\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\n(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\nI need some analgesic\/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd \nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\n\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\nbut I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\na reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\nI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\nI've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\nI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\nthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?\nMy doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\npain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\nsuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.\n\nAnyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.","target":3}

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\n\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\n\nJohn Sorenson\nCarol Sigelman\nCarla Moore\nBarbara Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text \/ graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\n\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nan Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX\/DCX format.  \nWhile most of my faxes were received in \"standard\" mode (200x100 dpi), the \naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. \n\nOverall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the \nlimitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just \ntoo small. \n\nIf anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                         Emerging Infectious Diseases\n                         ============================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n                                 Introduction\n\n     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would \nsoon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \nthe United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians\/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians\/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial\/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian\/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Over the course of\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\n\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement).

{"text":"Subject: Re: Eugenics\n\/\n;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. \n;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n\"1984.\"   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.","target":3}

I've been seeing \nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1\/2 pounds every \n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \nwhen I do need to go out.) \n\nAnyway that's 1\/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \nwasn't as much of a problem.\n\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.

This means no meat \nexcept fish and chicken w\/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \ntemporary for that one week. \n\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she \nassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that \nbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to \nuse the energy from the food I do eat. \n\nAny opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm \ntruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet \nbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few \nminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I \ndon't find any foods satisfying.\n\nThanks ","target":3}

The 1986 Safe\nDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either\nfilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use\nfrom pollution,\" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving\ntowards eventually implementing filtration systems but are\nexpected to miss the law's deadline.\n   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already\na reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface\nwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent\nof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism\ncryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite\ncalled giardia.\n   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office\nstudy released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee\nChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the\nnation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary\nsurveys of water systems.\n   \"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions\nof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be\nassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately\nput into place programs to protect water sources from\ncontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment\nmust be installed to protect the public,\" Olson noted.  \"The time\nhas come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop\ndragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from\ncontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs\nneeded to assure their water is safe to drink.\"\n   NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\n\n   Systems EPA Indicates Require Filtration and Do Not Adequately\nProtect Watersheds\n\n CONNECTICUT\n\n Bridgeport            Bridgeport Hydraulic Co.\n\n MASSACHUSETTS\n Boston                H2O Resource Author (MWRA)\n Medford               MWRA-Medford Water Dept\n Melrose               MWRA-Melrose Water Dept\n Hilton                MWRA-Hilton Water Dept\n Needham               MWRA-Needham Water Division\n Newtoncenter          MWRA-Newton Water Dept.\n Marblehead            MWRA-Marblehead Water Dept\n Quincy                MWRA-Quincy Water Dept\n Norwood               MWRA-Norwood Water Dept\n Framingham            MWRA-Framingham Water Div\n Cambridge             MWRA-Cambridge Water Dept\n Canton                MWRA-Canton Water Div-DPW\n Chelsea               MWRA-Chelsea Water Dept\n Everett               MWRA-Everett Water Dept\n Lexington             MWRA-201 Bedford (PUO WRKS)\n Lynn                  MWRA-Lynn Water & Sewer Co\n Malden                MWRA-Malden Water Division\n Revere                MWRA-Revere Water Dept\n Woburn                MWRA-Woburn Water Dept\n Swampscott            MWRA-Swampscott Water Dept\n Saugus                MWRA-Saugus Water Dept\n Somerville            MWRA-Somerville Water Dept\n Stoneman              MWRA-Stoneman Water Dept\n Brookline             MWRA-Brookline Water Dept\n Wakefield             MWRA-Same as Above\n Waltham               MWRA-Waltham Water Division\n Watertown             MWRA-Watertown Water Division\n Weston                MWRA-Weston Water Dept\n Dedham                MWRA-Dedham-Westwood District\n Winchester            MWRA-Winchester Water & Sewer\n Winthrop              MWRA-Winthrop Water Dept\n Boston                MWRA-Boston Water & Sewer Co\n S.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

Of course, it is possible\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\nsymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\n \n\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\nupon what it is about the compound that \"pisses off\" their body.\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\nperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. \n\n\nSee above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\n\nand brain damage. \n\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\n\n\npoisoning. \n\nAbsolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,\nsay, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus\ntoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,\nplus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days\nbefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of\nthings.\n\nBut it might be the MSG. \n\n\nIf noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably\nstomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.\n\n\nAnyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their\nresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.","target":3}

Miracle\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\nsour as well.\n\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\n\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \nAssociation's medical section.  \n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \nand bronchitis in children.  \n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nacid aerosols.  \n     \"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \nlike the Seattle study.  \n     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's \nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn't have \nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\n\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.

Within the program, there are four types \nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \nprevention and control research. \n \nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened \nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew \nprogressively. \n \nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \nfor comprehensive status. \n \nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \ninto clinical practice. \n \nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \nthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass \nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \nsources. \n \nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \n \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \n \nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \n \nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \n \nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \n \nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \n \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\n1918 University Boulevard\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\n(205) 934-6612\n \nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\nTucson, Arizona 85724\n(602) 626-6372\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\n \nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\n200 Medical Plaza\nLos Angeles, California 90027\n(213) 206-0278\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\n \nKenneth T.

The \ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's \nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the \nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \nyears.\n\n==================================================================    \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04\/12\/93) Vol. \n114, No. 14, P. 18 \n\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, \nthe manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the \ndrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \ndrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \nmany argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \nAIDS symptoms.

{"text":"\nPurists often distinguish between \"true\" clubbing and \"pseudo\"\nclubbing, the difference being that with \"true\" clubbing the\nangle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly\nnegative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).\nWith \"pseudo\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then\nnegative, which is the normal situation. \"Real\" internists\ncan talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple\nof minutes.\n\nWhether this distinction has anything to do with reality is\nentirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists\nlove to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \"true\" clubbing\nis associated with disease. The problem is that the list of\ndiseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes\nboth congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of\nthese diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems\nleading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is\nvery reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the \ncongenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac\ncatheterization. \n\nThe cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to\nsome factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to\ndilate abnormally. \n\nClubbing is one of those things from an examination which is\na tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,\nthe cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.","target":3}

Also, I hope it can be used as an \nexample and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters \nand data related to organ transplantation and donation.  \n\nMike\n\nTransplant Recipients\nInternational Organization\nLong Island Chapter\nP.O. Box 922\nHuntington, NY 11743-0922\t\t NEWSLETTER\n516\/421-3258\n                                         APRIL 1993 \n                                         VOLUME IV   No. 8\n\n\nNEXT MEETING\n\n\nThe next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights \nof Columbus Emerald Manor, 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale.  \nOur guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman \ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \nDr. Teperman. \n\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\n\n\nLAST MEETING\n\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \nher for an entertaining evening.\n\n\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \nslate for the Board.\n\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\n\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\n\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\n\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \nmembers and there is plenty of work. \n\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\n\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\n\nFUTURE MEETINGS\n\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \n\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\n\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \n\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\n\nNOTDAW\n\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \n\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\n\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \n\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\n\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \n\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1\/2 years.  He is home and doing \nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\n\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \n     \nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \nand feeling better.  \n\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \n\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a \ncandidate for the Board so we need her well soon.\n \nAnd best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough \nwinter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.","target":3}

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and\/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq\/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.

{"text":"\nWhether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or\ndreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or\nsitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of\nintense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam\nfreely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming\nup with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis\nof the problem first.  \n\nScientific intuition is not something one is born with.

{"text":"This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\nI'd never seen before.\n\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\n\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\n\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\n\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\nand concerns me are:\n\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\n\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\n\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\n    so.\n\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\n\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.","target":3}

Our  \nthree year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  \nthat appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

{"text":"GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\n\n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and\/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU\/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram\/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis\/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast\/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast\/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast\/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast\/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis\/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast\/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved\/proven\/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute\/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his\/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.

{"text":"\n[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\n\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n\tclean bill of health.\n\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\n\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n\tof selected foods omitted]\n\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\n\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\n","target":3}

{"text":"I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\n\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \nper day).\n\n\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \n\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\n\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\n\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\n\n\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \n\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\n\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \n\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\n\n\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\n\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \n\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\n\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \nbefore supplementation.\n\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about \nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \nin urinary oxalate excretion.\n\n\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\n\n\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\n\t   Contain at least 25mg\/100grams\n\n\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \n\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\n\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg\/100grams.\n\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't \nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \n\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \nformation should be given B6 supplements.\n\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \nCa\/Mg dietary ratio is 2\/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \ncalcium-oxalate.\n\n\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\n\n\t5. \"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \ninteraction\"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).\n\n\t6.Review Article, \"Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment \nof renal calcium stones\" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\n\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I \nguess that he doesn't read the medical literature.

Generally, the individual attempts to ignore\nor suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  \nThe individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather\nthan being from an external source.\n\nExamples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,\nor other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a\nsource of the anxiety.\n\nIn OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the\nindividual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their\ndaily routine and social relationships.\n\nTreatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes\ncertain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating\nobsessions and compulsions.\n\nThe standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the\nDSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkind regards,","target":3}

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)\/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD\/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD\/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD\/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation\/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney\/ureter, and scoliosis\/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm\/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm\/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and\/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and\/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and\/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs\/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand\/or idiopathic infertility.    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm\/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and\/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n","target":3}

I will probably respond to them however with a reminder\nof how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the\ntobacco companies still deny).\n\n- DM\n\n(If I sound grumpy, it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch\ntoday, and now it hurts to swallow)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDan Myers (Madman)\t\t| If the creator had intended us to walk \nmyers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu\t| upright, he wouldn't have given us knuckles","target":3}

{"text":"\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\nthere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof \"reason and observation.\"\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

The better ones also include\nadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to\n \nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\n\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your \nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\n\n \n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tBright Star\n\tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\n    Description:\n\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \n\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).

It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar \/ batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar\/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub\/typing-injury\/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub\/typing-injury\/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n","target":3}

The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP\/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04\/07\/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV\/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04\/07\/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS\/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \"We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children.\" \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \ninfection or AIDS. \n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV\/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV\/AIDS patients they serve.\" \n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\f\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------\n","target":3}

{"text":"\nFlights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\n\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.

CRITZ, III\" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM>\nSubject: EnviroLeague\n\n\"Birth Announcement\" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe\n                       Information Service\n===================================================================\n \n                     FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n                     -------------------\n \n                                     (SM)\n                        EnviroLeague\n \nA new youth movement,\"EnviroLeague,\" was recently born, according to its\nfounder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\nenvironment.\n \nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\nObjectives:\n \n                           MISSION\n \n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\n   which we must all live.\n \n                         OBJECTIVES\n \n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\n   objectives shall be:\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\n            focus the education and participatory\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\n            of environmental concern;\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\n            their branches a full complement of program\n            materials for their use, including suitable\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\n            desirable;\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\n            of program ideas, materials and information\n            among said organizations;  and\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\n \nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\nyouth membership.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\n \nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\nportions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\nplace.\n \nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\nForums.\n \nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\n============================================================================\n \nSubsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:\n       EnviroLeague\n       P.O.

As I mentioned in the Tradition\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\n\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\n     the same way?\n\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\n# who has been blind from birth.

But, like all models, a compro-\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\n\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\n     not some metaphor for something else.\n\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\n\n     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\n\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\n\n\nStephen\n\n    _\/_\/_\/_\/  _\/_\/_\/_\/   _\/       _\/    * Atheist\n   _\/        _\/    _\/   _\/ _\/ _\/ _\/     * Libertarian\n  _\/_\/_\/_\/  _\/_\/_\/_\/   _\/   _\/  _\/      * Pro-individuality\n       _\/  _\/     _\/  _\/       _\/       * Pro-responsibility\n_\/_\/_\/_\/  _\/      _\/ _\/       _\/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n","target":0}

Let's try to discuss these\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.","target":0}

A small minority of those who do believe\nreads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes,\nbut doesn't know what or how. \n\nPeople don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,\nthey only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say\nthat they are not \"born in the Spirit\", but this does not disturb them.\nReligion is not something to think about. \n\nI'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible\ndream.

{"text":"[why do babies get diseases, etc.]\n\n Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably \nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\nhow could it exist before humans?\n\n[deletions]\n\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\ncollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\n\n\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\nbe getting less nasty w\/age...\n\n\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\n\n\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\nof did It just choose not to?\n\n[deletions]\n\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\nthe explanation you give.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\nThat you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate.

This is an important \ndistinction.\n\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \noutwardly profess\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\n\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu'min\", which means \"true\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\nwill not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu'min\", or \"true believer\" in\nIslam.","target":0}

He was unable\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.

Without delving into a deep discussion of\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\n\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\nof this statement, shouldn't we?\n\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\n\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \n\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \n\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \nTry Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\n& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\n\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\n: scientific perspective, just different.\n\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\n \n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\n: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\n\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\n\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\nmore important than we've thought - for instance, sex might\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \n \n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\n\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \n\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\n\nI'd replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\nevolve.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \n\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\n: >>diseases, both bacterial\/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \n\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \n\nI can understand Scott's reaction:\n\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\n: > jesting.

Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \n: \n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\n: cannot *know* that.\n\nI hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\nand not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. \n\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\n\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\n: >>diseases\/disorders.\n\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it \nto the present. \n\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either\nclaim.\n \n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\n: answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\n\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does\nnot work, it fails miserably.\n \n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\n: \n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\n: that affect mankind?  I don't think so.\n\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\n\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\n: Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\n: universe.\n\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\n\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\n  \n: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)\n\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\n\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\n\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\nthese books.\n\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\n \n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\n: of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\n: environment.\n\nI'm sorry, but they do.

As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \nthat faith healers can pull off today.

Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\nall other possible alternatives.\n\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\n\n->\tSome other things to note.

{"text":" \n: There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread\n: that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\n\n There is no need\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\n: determnined.\n\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\n: establish your values.\n\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\n\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \n\nPetri\n","target":0}

{"text":"\nYes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\nthat\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\nby the death penalty.\n\nMy understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\n\n\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.","target":0}

For\ninstance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a\nplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\ncontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\ncontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\ntalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.

Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\n\n\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.

{"text":"Archive-name: atheism\/faq\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: faq\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\nVersion: 1.1\n\n                    Alt.Atheism Frequently-Asked Questions\n\nThis file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in\nalt.atheism.  Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the\n\"Introduction to Atheism\"; you are advised to read that article as well\nbefore posting.\n\nThese answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of\nthe periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If\nyou have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't\ncovered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.\n\nOverview of contents:\n\n   \"What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\"\n   \"Hitler was an atheist!\"\n   \"The Bible proves it\"\n   \"Pascal's Wager\"\n   \"What is Occam's Razor?\"\n   \"Why it's good to believe in Jesus\"\n   \"Why I know that God exists\"\n   \"Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\"\n   \"Everyone worships something\"\n   \"Why there must be a causeless cause\"\n   \"The universe is so complex it must have been designed\"\n   \"Independent evidence that the Bible is true\"\n   \"Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\"\n   \"George Bush on atheism and patriotism\"\n   \"I know where hell is!\"\n   \"Biblical contradictions wanted\"\n   \"The USA is a Christian nation\"\n   \"The USA is not a Christian nation\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nWhy have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?  \nWhat is there to discuss?\n\nResponse:\n\nMany things are discussed here, including:\n\n* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's\n  family\n* Prayer in schools\n* Discrimination against atheists\n* Sunday trading laws\n* The Satanic Child Abuse myth\n* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'\n* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students\n* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers\n* Whether religion is a danger to society and\/or the individual\n* Why people become atheists\n\nOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians\nlooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't \nwant to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure \nfrom tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Hitler was an atheist!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!\n\nResponse:\n\nThere are several towns called \"Hell\" in various countries around the\nworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly\namusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now \ngetting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Biblical contradictions wanted\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDoes anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?\n\nResponse:\n \nAmerican Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical\ncontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\ndetails.\n\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\n\nResponse:\n\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not.\"\n      - James Madison, \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\", 1785\n\n  \"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  \"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose.\"\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  \"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it.\"\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from \"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans' \"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n","target":0}

{"text":"#In <1qvabj$g1j@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) \n#\n#>In article <C5qGM3.DL8@news.cso.uiuc.edu> cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike \n#\n#Am I making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals?  Where do they come \n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\n#whatever is societally mandated.\n\nIt's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\n\n#\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\n#>#\n#>#Moral\/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\n#>#\n#>#1)Who is society\n#\n#>Depends on the society.\n#\n#Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?\n\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\nthe rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should\nmake the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either,\nbut I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\n\n#\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\n#\n#>Depends.\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\n\nWell, ideally they don't, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\n#\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\n#\n#>By adopting a default position that people's moral decisions\n#>are none of society's business,\n#\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\n\nBecause sometimes that's necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.\n\n# and only interfering when it's truly\n#>necessary.\n#\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\n\nIMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of\nliar's paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if\nwe don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.\n#\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\n#\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\n\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\n\n#  Thus you\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I've\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \n#\n#I admit I don't understand that statement.\n\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\nalso be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don't let yourself\ndo it.  Eating meat, for example.","target":0}

After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological\npatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating\nthat you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some\natheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed\nwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed\nto do so.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your\nstereotype?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\n2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \"senses and\nreason are all we have to go by\", and when pressed, you have implied\nthat we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly\nasked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both\nexperience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses\nand reason.  You failed to do so.

If so, please repeat them.\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\n\n4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as\na result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the\n\"axioms\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked\nyou to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement\nthat the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that\nI have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer\nthe question.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become\natheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that\neffect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the\nsubsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably\nresult in atheism?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n[First quote]\n[Second quote]\n\n\n5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these\nChallenges because they contained too much in the way of \"included\ntext\" from previous posts.

{"text":"Archive-name: atheism\/introduction\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: introduction\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\nVersion: 1.2\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\n                          An Introduction to Atheism\n                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\n\nThis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\n\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\n\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\nmay not.\n\n\"What is atheism?\"\n\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\natheism\".\n\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\nflat-out denials.\n\n\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n\nThe term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\nsure whether God exists.\n\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\nyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\n\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\nsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\nabout the universe.\n\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\nsee no evidence that God exists.\n\n\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\n\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\nmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\nprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\nthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\nprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\nby any present-day religion exists.\n\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\nGod are not really applicable.\n\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\ndetectable.\n\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\nimportance whether he exists or not.\n\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\n\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\nfrom all the other things that don't exist?\n\n\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\nthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\nworship.\n\n[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\n\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\n\n\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n\nFirstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\nactually believes in.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\n\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\"\n\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\nmany countries.\n\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\n\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\nchurch and state should remain separate.\n\n\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n surely that's the same as state atheism?\"\n\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\nnature.\n\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\n\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n pray?\"\n\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\nthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\n\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\nmotives.\n\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\n\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\nof religious beliefs.\n\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\nrather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n\n\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\n\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\n\nIt's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\nexpectations of others.\n\nOn the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\n\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\n\nThey don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.\n\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\nappearance.\n\n\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\"\n\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\natheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\n\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\nof self-preservation.\n\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\nwhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.\n\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\nactions.  For example:\n\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\n\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n   before salvation; 5% after.\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\n\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\nbehaviour.\n\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\n\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n\n\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\n\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\nwith what they observed around them.\n\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\nindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\nchoice that person can honestly make.\n\n\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\"\n\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\n\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\n\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\"\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\nfutile.\n\n\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\n\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\nthat has a \"meaning\".\n\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\n\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n\nIn the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just\nhard luck.\n\n\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\n\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\n\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n\nThousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments\n apply?\"\n\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\nbut to everyone else.\n\n\"What sort of harm?\"\n\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\n\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\nreligion.\n\n\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n sort of excuse.\"\n\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL\nChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?\n\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\naren't a perversion of what your God intended?\n\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\nChristian.\n\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\n\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\ndon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.\n\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n\n\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\"\n\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n\nOf course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\npurposes as well.\n\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n something?\"\n\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\n\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n that God exists?\"\n\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\n\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n nothing?\"\n\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\n\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\nother memes.\n\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\n\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\n\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\nfew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\nreligions.\n\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\n\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\n\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to\n   find it.\n\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.\n\n   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\n   yourself.\n\n   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.\n\n   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.\n\n   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.\n\nand finally (and most importantly):\n\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\n\n\nmathew\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY\/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6\/9bV9okE\/q\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\n=q2V5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","target":0}

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\n\nBut first let me say the following.\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\nI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it's\n'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\nGod\".\n \nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\n\nfaith \n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\nb  (1): fidelity to one's promises\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   (2): complete trust\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nof religious beliefs\nsyn see BELIEF\n\n\n\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \ndoes\/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be \nglad to.) \n\n\n\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \ndisagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \nthinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \nways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  \nthought out discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","target":0}

It\nseemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.

It seems from your\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\nI apologize.\n\n\nI have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb\nshould have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good,\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\n\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\n\n\nI don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \n\n[...]\n\n\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\nback-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't\ncare, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil \ninterests, caused us to take action.\n\n\n[...]\n\nI'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\n\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\nwould lead their nation to.\n\n\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\nbut that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nProbably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\nsome other places.\n\nTell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not\nagree with the present US policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it.\nI agree that it is deplorable.\n\n\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\nis in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\nthe system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial \nprejudice thrown around.\n\n\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\n\n\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn't mean \"those who do the same thing\",\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\nposition to understand the defendent's motivation(s).\n\n\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\n\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\n\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don't accept (without *far*\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\n\n\nHardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\n\n\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\nand suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\n\nBut don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\ndon't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\n\n\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\n\n\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\n\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the\nsame claim.\n\n\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\nwasn't accurate enough to hit industrial\/military targets in a\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \nthe Allied bombing.\n\nRegards,","target":0}

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\nwill take particular claims at face value.\n\nImmanuel:\n\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n       spoken by a prophet:\n\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\n       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more.\"   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\nthe message of the church's gospel.\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases.\"\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name.\"\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them.\"\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed\/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world.\"\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\n       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\f\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt.\"\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\n\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool.\"\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever.\"\n\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses & Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter's\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n& Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\n       don't know what they do!\"\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\f\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!\"\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.","target":0}

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n\"A Maze of Death\"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n\"VALIS\"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

It is possible to objectively\ndetermine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.\nI agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that\neverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that\nit cannot be objective in theory.\n\n\nPerhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,\nthe practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely\nthe only ones to be considered \"immoral\" under the previous \"definitions\"\nof the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the\nclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.\n\n\nIt seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system\nbecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would\nnecessitate some sort of grand design?\n\n\nI think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired\nbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,\nor destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,\nimmoral to what end?).","target":0}

But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for\npeople that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems\nfor us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking\nclinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.\n\n\nSo, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a\nwhole room of them?  A whole nation?\n\n\nYes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However,\nI think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted\nwith what *could* happen (an what may be likely).\n\n\nWell, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the\nmotto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed\nin a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say,\nbut I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively\ndespise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.\n\n\nWell, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think\nthat it is applicable to them.

That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included\nall atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes\n(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.\nThey advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not\nmentioned.\n\n\nSo, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions\nshould be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly.\nI think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.\n\n\nI think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight\ncost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by\nbeing on our currency.\n\n\nWell, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it\nshould be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the\nconsequences.\n\n\nThen you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.\n\n\nWhy not?

Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory \/pub\/usenet\/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet\/news.answers\/ftp-list\/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet\/news.answers\/finding-sources\n      send usenet\/alt.atheism\/faq\n      send usenet\/alt.atheism\/introduction\n      send usenet\/alt.atheism\/logic\n      send usenet\/alt.atheism\/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism\/faq\/faq.txt\n      send atheism\/faq\/logic.txt\n      send atheism\/faq\/intro.txt\n      send atheism\/faq\/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\n   \"send atheism\/index\".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n","target":0}

{"text":"\n\nI assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has\nTony Campello read?  Not much it seems. \n\n\nIt is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.\nIf only those christian \"scientists\" would take note.\n\n(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian \nscientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly\ntrue, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified\nby using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are \ntrying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the\nerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed \nlight has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been \naccounted for. :-] )\n\n\nOr (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never \nintended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one\nup?\n\n\nMillions of people have \"died for a lie\".  This  point is difficult to \nsubstantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments\nwork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed \nthemselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory\nof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\n\n  \nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\nto become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to\nthe claim that Jesus was the \"real thing\".\n\n\n\nHave you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \nhis principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler\nwas sane....\n\n \n\n\nHmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\"\n\n\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\npeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \n\nTony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\n\n  \n\n\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\nclaiming to be correct.  \n\nIt \n\nI think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames\nthan here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments\nof a stranger should be of interest to other people. \n\nSomeone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one\nrules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.

{"text":"Archive-name: atheism\/logic\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\nVersion: 1.4\n\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\n\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when\nyou've heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\n\"therefore\".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God.\"\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\n\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\nB\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\n\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. \nIf the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent's particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent's argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou're white.\"\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\n\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred.\"\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me\nguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\n\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\nand\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer\"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists.\"\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT \/ HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere.\"\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION \/ DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA \/ POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache.\"\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons.\"\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice.\"\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION \/ FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\nor\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\nand\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight.\"\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana.\"\n\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES \/ \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of\nhistory?\"\n\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a\nform of Christianity?\"\n\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because \"that's the way it's always been.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM \/ MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION \/ HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\n\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n\"You're just being randomly abusive.\"\n\"So?  You've been abusive too.\"","target":0}

{"text":"\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\n\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\ntyrant-dictator. \n\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\nI don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\nwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\nlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\nwishes to stay free.   \n\n\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\n\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\nshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking\nGerman instead of English right now.\n\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\nthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!\n\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \n\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\na reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.

His anti-Islamic\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\non telling half-truths.\n\nAgain, read \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\n_yourself_.\n\n\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\n\n\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\n\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\n\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\nexcellent article.  \n\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\n\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\nhadiths to support its point of view.\n\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\ncourse not.\n\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\nonly an idiot would think so.\n\nDo you see my point?\n\n\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\n\n\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\n\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\nIslam => lack of education and power.\n\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\nother reasons for this situation.\n\n\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\nfollowing the Qur'an or not.\n\n\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur'an\"\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\nfact which contradicts your theory. \n\n\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\nthis.\n\n\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\n\n\nHere too.\n\n\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\n\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

{"text":"\n\n\n\n\nOkay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\n\n\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \n\n\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\n\n\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\n\n\nThe Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\nProphet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\n\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.","target":0}

{"text":"[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]\n \n \n \n \nFor many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an\nepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of\nknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\n \nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\nof any possibility of proof.

The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nSure.

But then\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.

Here's the example:\n \n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\n\n Weak atheism   - \"I don't believe in a god\"       a negative belief\n \n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)\n \n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\n \n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\n \n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\n \n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\n \n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....) \n\n\n\n Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not\n  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always \n  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival\n  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.\n\n","target":0}

Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \n\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\nparts of Man's history.@\n\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\nfurther their means.

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth\/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth\/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.\"\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity\").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

(Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)\n(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was\nprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)\n\tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo\npopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population is\nruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you\nhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism\nof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start\nto see for example the Andromeda's bursters.\n\tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution\n(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with\nthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence\nisotropy) and the edge is \"the edge of the Universe\" ;-)\nIf at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)\nand a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star\ncolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\n\n\tIf we know anything about physics at that level,\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\nthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\n\n   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering\n   hyperspace :-)\n\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\n\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...","target":4}

{"text":"Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News\/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS\/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \"The Last\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)","target":4}

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us\nsome new\/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS\/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn't spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's\nand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

{"text":"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What's New\" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......","target":4}
{"text":"\nI was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n\t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\n\t\t\t-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\nbase, BTW]\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm\/m2 ensures that heat\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\ncontainer.\n\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\ninformation.\n\n\tAndy\n\n\n\n-- ","target":4}

With only one detector, one cannot\nlocate a burst (except to say \"It's somewhere in the field of view.\").

It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).","target":4}

This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.

These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.

{"text":"        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no\nnotes so I'll try to wing it...  \n        Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that \nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\nthey don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.  ","target":4}

The conference was organised by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\n\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\n       examples.\n\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20\/30 GHz band.\n\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\n\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\nworld's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\n\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\nof the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\norganisation.\n\n\n\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\nEUTELSAT.","target":4}

{"text":"   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..\n   Why not??\n\nBecause to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where\nit is, which means you either nail it to something that doesn't move\nor you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on a\ndeactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far away\nfrom it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on\nboard. \n\nApart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons.","target":4}

{"text":"SSRT ROLLOUT\n\n                Speech Delivered by Col. Simon P. Worden,\n                     The Deputy for Technology, SDIO\n                                    \n                  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach\n                              April 3,1993\n\n     Most of you, as am I, are \"children of the 1960's.\"  We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - \"you've lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened\nto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\ndidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we'll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn\nV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!","target":4}

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ\/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\n    discussion.\n\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\n\n    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\n\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\n\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\n    FAQ postings.\n\n\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\n\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups.

But they have been systematically \n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \n\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \n    \n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \n          DATUM\"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was\/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE \/ MASS, (a = F\/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \n          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses \n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \n    \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \n","target":4}

{"text":"Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m\/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm\/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km\/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km\/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n","target":4}

(818) 354-5011\n\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\n#1506\n\n     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.\n\n     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow\/Daggett Airport\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \n\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\nDiscovery.\n\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\nthe balloon research campaign.  \n\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\nright.\"\n\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\n\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \n\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\nto separate from the balloon.\n\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\n\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\nscientists.    \n\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\ncontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\n\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\n\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\nProgram.

{"text":"NASA Headquarters distributed the following press\nrelease today (4\/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President's new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"","target":4}

{"text":"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1\/3\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\n\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\nIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\nthey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\n\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\n                  ______\n3 G         \/|   \/      |\n           \/ |  \/       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \n          \/  | \/        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\n2 G      \/   |\/         |          made by the  \/  should be curves which are\n        \/               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\n       \/                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.\n1 G   \/                 |\n                        |\n                        |\n0 G                     |\n\n             ^          ^\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\n\n\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\nout entirely.\n\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \nthat desired.\n\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\n\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\n    all at once?\n\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\n\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\n\nA:  Can't tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \n\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\n\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about \n60 degrees south latitude.\n\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that\naspect of the flight profile.\n","target":4}

Thanks to Andy Odell\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\nattention.\n\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\n\n\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.

My impression would\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\n\njay","target":4}

This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA\/JSC\/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368","target":4}

{"text":"\n   {Description of \"External Tank\" option for SSF redesign deleted}\n\n\nYo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today's (4\/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday's Times).\n\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle\/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter\/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.","target":4}

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware\/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1\/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

Until you do that you are barking in the wind.\n\n\nIntegration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was \ndone here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \nApollo?\n\n\nOh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.\nThey should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it\nreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your\nbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just\nhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \n\n\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\nefforts that you do not see this.\n\n\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \nhappened in the first place.\n\nI have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is\nat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally\nignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that\nhas grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to \nchange the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of\nyour position.","target":4}

This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1\/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1\/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.","target":4}

{"text":"ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!\n\n  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, \nether sucking structures, AND why we observe \"orbital\" motion!!\n\n  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic \nwaves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the \nMichelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago. \n\n  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact \nthat the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the \nearth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\n\n  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is \nitself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around\nby the sun's ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as \"earth's\" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       \/     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ \/                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon's image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine's receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don't want to be a part of. ","target":4}

{"text":"Archive-name: space\/probe\nLast-modified: $Date: 93\/04\/01 14:39:19 $\n\nPLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS\n\n    This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes\n    (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\n\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\n\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\n\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\n    geological and biological sense.\n\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\n    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\n    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\n    of an ocean.\n\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\n    launcher autopilot failed.\n\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\n    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\n\n\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\n\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\n\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\n    to do so.\n\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\n    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\n    its batteries failed.\n\n\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\n\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\n\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\n\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\n\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\n\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\n\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\n\n\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\n\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\n\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\n\n\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\n\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\n\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\n    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.\n\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\n\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\n    down on April 12, 1980.\n\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\n\n\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\n\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\n\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot\/band cycle\n    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\n\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\n\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\n    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)\n\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\n    location of the heliopause.\n\n\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\n\n\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\n\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\n\t     craft in solar orbit.\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\n\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\n\t     from surface.\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8\n\t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were\n\t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.\n    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil\n\t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\n\t      1972.\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's\n\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\n\t      with LUNA 21\/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\n\t      1976.\n\n\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\n\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\n\t       lost enroute in 1961.\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\n\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\n\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\n\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\n\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\n\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\n\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\n\t       similar in 1969.\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\n\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\n\t       1972.\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\n\t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar\n\t       mission.\n    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.\n\t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.\n    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of\n\t\tplanet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.\n    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian\n\t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on\n\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\n\t     March of 1986.\n\n\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\n\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\n\t     enroute the following year.\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\n\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\n\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\n\t     Planet in 1971.\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\n\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\n\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\n\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\n\t     probe MARINER 9.\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\n\t     with its flyby bus.\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest\n\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\n\t       human\/computer error.\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\n\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\n\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\n\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\n    space program remains to be seen.\n\n\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field\/plasma waves\/solar wind, all of\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\n\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\n\n\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\n\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March\n    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\n\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\n    approach:\n\n\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\n\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\n\tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\n\tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days\n\n\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\n\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\n    background.

Good university libraries will carry\n    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission\n    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study\n    some of the books listed above.\n\n    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL\n    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's\n    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,\n    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER\n    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the\n    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions\n    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\n    probably know.\n\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their\n    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe\n    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\n\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\n\n    Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com","target":4}

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202\/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713\/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\"\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field\/Planetary Camera (WF\/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF\/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\"\nHeflin said.  \"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives.\"\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.

{"text":"In the April edition of \"One Small Step for a Space Activist\",\nAllen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:\n  \"Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes\n   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won't be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer\/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04\/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1\/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1\/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten\nup by the center tax?)\"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all\ngo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\na burecratic nightmare!","target":4}

{"text":"\nFor the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)\/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper\/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren't they reusable\/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal\/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and\/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth\/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?","target":4}

By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\nand Whirlwind had their power\/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\n\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\nvieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\n\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\neen apart vel.\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde.

De op te vangen signalen zijn\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\n\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

{"text":"McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X\n\n        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern\nCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last\nSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. \"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today's engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\nparents' time.\"\n\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. \"It's essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\n\n        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\nwe're going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't\nsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let's not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\ninvestments.\"\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.","target":4}

{"text":"\nThe Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate \nonto the Proton as the T4\/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh \nenvorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. \n\nYou've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. \nIt cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, \nthe pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+\/- 5 psi. \nThat is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure \nstabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions\n(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make \na non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. \n\nThe Atlas\/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4\/Centaur\ndoes.

RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t\/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20\/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don't worry \nbecause we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.\n","target":4}

In\n    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n    special 'servers'.\n\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\n\n    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',\n    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called\n    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n    posted.\n\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n    accessible as mailing lists.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\n\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier\/DSN (Deep Space Network)\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\n\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\nthe model developed by the AC\/DC special anomaly team.\n\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate\/Sensor - 3.15rpm\/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate\/antenna- 40bps(coded)\/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe\/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC","target":4}

{"text":"\n  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago\nabout breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)\nAs far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult\nto do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:\n  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out \n    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own\n    breathing effort (let alone anything else)\n\n  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is\n    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled\n    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\n\n  - oxygen\/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\n    gas per unit volume. \n\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that... \n","target":4}

{"text":"Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For\nexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  \n\nI've heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter\/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n\"drift\" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n","target":4}

{"text":"From another space forum\n    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56\n solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers\n lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived\n the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot\n altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.\n\n    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,\n\n    \"It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've\n lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.\"\n\n    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a\n Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on\n April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the\n report and Discovery was launched with its \"extra payload\".  NASA\n officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th\n launch date.\n\n    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB\n technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,\n its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a\n part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.\n\n    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that\n the Shuttle processor will take \"appropriate action\".  Thiokol is a\n subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nKarl Anderson\t\nDEV\/2000: Configuration Management\/Version Control\n\nDept 53K\/006-2\t\tRochester, Minnesota 55901\n253-8044\t\tTie 8-453-8044\nINTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.com\nPRODIGY: CMMG96A","target":4}

Others claim to be staying of their own free\nwill, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\n\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to \"have hardware which will blow\nanything else away\", while more recently he claims they have stopped\nmanufacturing their own.\n\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\npossibly Canon equipment.\n\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as \"Bill\" and\nclaims to be the \"MS-iah\".\n\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\n\"interpersonal computing\" which rejects traditional roles.\n\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\nfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares\nthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own\napocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers\ncarry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling \"I\nwant to welcome you to the 'Next World' \".","target":4}

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.","target":4}

Have fun! \n\nCONTENTS:\n1- US COMMERCIAL SPACE SALES FLATTEN IN 1993\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \n5- ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\nFINAL NOTES\n  \nARTICLES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1- US COMMERCIAL SPACE SALES FLATTEN IN 1993\n   The US Department of Commerce projects US commercial space sales \nwill remain flat in 1993, with current data showing only a 2 percent \ngrowth over 1992.  As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M\/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS\/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing\/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst's report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia\/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN\/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995\/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US\/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish\/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher\/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970's and early 1980's. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center\/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite's communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese\/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\n2\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's \naerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN\/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

{"text":"Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their\nERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb\/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40\/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100\/lb.  The $40\/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower\/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n","target":4}

So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\n    specialist\".\n\n    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1.

Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\n    preparation is important.\n\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20\/150 or better uncorrected,\n\t      correctable to 20\/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140\/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\n    academic preparation is important.\n\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\n    test experience highly desirable.\n\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20\/50 or better uncorrected\n\t      correctable to 20\/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140\/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n\tMedical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n\tNASA Johnson Space Center\n\tAstronaut Selection Office\n\tATTN: AHX\n\tHouston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.\n","target":4}

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS\/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2\/20\/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA\/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV\/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's\n    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn's rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10\/06\/97 - Titan IV\/Centaur Launch\n\t   04\/21\/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06\/20\/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08\/16\/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12\/30\/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06\/25\/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01\/09\/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01\/30\/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06\/25\/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7\/22\/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment.

{"text":"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity\/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS\/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle\/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle\/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle\/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO\/Spacehab\/COMET or SSTO\/SIF\/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas\/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover\/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n","target":4}

{"text":" (excerpts from posting on this topic) \n\n\n(I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o) \n\n\nNow my comments: \n\nI'd like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. ","target":4}

The magnitude of such accelerations he\nestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not\nbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published\nin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very\nlong-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in\nfact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of\ncourse.

{"text":"I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me.\nBut here is how i understand it.\n\nAt Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.\nIt becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the\nwing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.\n\nIf they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force\ncompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).\n\nIf you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend\ninto,  then drag is reduced.   \n\nEssentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf\nremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are\nsubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.","target":4}

I would guess that a tiny fraction\nof 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of\ndoubt that even you agree with it.\n\nI'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because, \nafter all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.\n\nI'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the\nAAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex\ndiscrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.\n\n\nI've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience\nwith her ability as an umpire.\n\nBut I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be\nthat she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the\numpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems\nto me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees\nthe role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her\neither.\n\nThe umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners\nsafe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is\nto maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the\nplayers from trying to kill each other. \n\nUmpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most\nof us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she\ndeserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of\nthe rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires\nneed to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.\n\n\n","target":2}

{"text":"Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \npredict a player's RBIs using information about his overall\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\n\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't \nhave team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \n\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\n\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\nfit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to \nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\n\nIt doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\ncould just be Ozzie.  The results:\n\n                           RBI-HR\n         Years        Actual   Predicted\nCarter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6\nClark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6\nMatt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8\nSmith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6\n\nI think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that\nRBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall\nand how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.\n\nMore later,\nHarold","target":2}

His equivalent\naverage started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So\nlet us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level\nof play.\n\nThat is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top\nten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave\nWinfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,\nan incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better\nthan any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what\nMattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;\njust ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan\nKlesko's MLEs. \n\nHe got more attention from the media than was warranted from his\nbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.\nThat is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The\nmedia would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a\ngood, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best\nhitter in the majors.","target":2}

{"text":"\nThis was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The\nargument was\n\n1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.\n2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.\n\n3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and\nearned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%\nof defense and pitching is 88% of defense.\n4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.\n\nPete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in\nthe 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and\npitching.\n\n\nI'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or\neven 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds\nidentical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and\neven if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot\nmore than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often.

It might be that pre-back\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\ncaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\nhim.

Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs\/game\nand giving up 6.6\/game. \n\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game\nwith California was cancelled.","target":2}

{"text":"\n\nI'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n\nFelix Jose has been a .350\/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330\/.530 player.\nMaybe .330\/.550 .  Not even close.\n\n\nI'd put him about there too.  \n\nNote: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

{"text":"\n\tOh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't \nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\nOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \n\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  \n\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been \na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \n\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you \nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\n\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.\n\n\n\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?\n\n\n\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\n80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\n\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\nstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\nSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.\n\n\n\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.\n\tSkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\nabout Morris' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris' \"ability\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned \nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\n80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\nnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\n\"consideration\".  \n\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's \njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\n(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)\n\tPuck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \ntragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the\nleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.\n\n\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \nor not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to\nsuffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.\n\n\n\n  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the\nclub.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of\nplayers..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have\nanother great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West. \n\nlousey spring.\n\n\n      Right!  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling\n      bullpen.\n\n\n\n      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the\n      club so far.  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting\n      on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to\n      assume Biggio and Finley's job.

If I'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate\nthe color orange (shiver..).  McLane's favorite color is red, so...\n     I'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound\nhorrible.  I'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.

At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.

I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\n\n\nYou don't have to be rude.\n\n\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\nindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of\ncomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-\nformance.\n\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new\nknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better\nthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less \nincorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.\n\n-- ","target":2}

But they do have others worth playing, at\nleast in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.\n\n\nI can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But\nAlomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.\nThat is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long\nas they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a\nconsensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to\ngive him that dreaded \"seasoning\".\n\n\nSorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.

Baseball\nis a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping\nLopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.\n\nI happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from\nyour armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of\nevidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among\nlarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I\nthink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.

Now that the fan has Mike\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\nMorning show:\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\nJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\nDuring the summer, it\nis all talk on WIP.\n\n\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \n\n\n\n            Rich","target":2}

Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.

{"text":"The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their\nquest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.\nPersonally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he\nhas also led the team in past years for hitting into double\nplays, or at least been among the leaders.\n \nSharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play\nevery day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just\none base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.\n \nWallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.\nThe improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an\neffect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez\nwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.\nMartinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might\nhave seen him lifted in the third in past years.\n \nAstacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.\nThe Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls\nin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great\non defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to\nsteal and has at least one pick off at first.\n \nWallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on\ndefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers\nsome runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.\nI suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw\nseem to have come out of theirs.","target":2}

The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  \njust age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.\n \nAll things considered, though, I'd be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  \nthe plate than Prince.

{"text":"So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.\n\n\n1) Zane Smith should learn how to \"switchpitch\" and return from the DL. I\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\n\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\n\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\nwasn't very fit last year.\n\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\nseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\n","target":2}

Steve Avery, for example,\nwas rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.\nHis subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie\nyear.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so\nand then rebound.\n\nBob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had\ngood numbers immediately.\n\nI am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and\nDerek Lilliquist.

{"text":"\n  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting \nBill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;\nhe was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't\nall-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when\neveryone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy\nCampanella. \n\n\n  Which reports are those? \n\n\n  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play\nhim IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.\nRight now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez\nwill be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they\nplay up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching\ntandem.  \n\n\n  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher\ndefense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from\nyour viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is\nopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. \n\n  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\nbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that\nthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \ndefensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of\nMel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich\nJays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. \nI'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative. \n ","target":2}

But giving Joe the benefit of the \n\tdoubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that\n\the didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his\n\tspeed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely\n\tconfused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that\n\tparticular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?\n\tWell, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing\n\tbut it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play \n\tJordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.\n\tYup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm\n\tgoing to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's\n\tgot Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - \n\tcoming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign \n\tin that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  \n\tIt's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin \n\twas there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  \n\tBTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third \n\tand going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the \n\treplay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a \n\tserious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year \n\tand I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.\n\n\tWell, I'm still hanging in there.\n\n\tGO REDBIRDS!!

{"text":"Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\nfuel to the flame!\n\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\/the\nfirst time Olson\/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz\/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter\/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you\never hire that guy anyhow?\n\nCox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush\t\tfierkelab@\tbchm.biochem.duke.edu\n\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

I'm serious; I\ntend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but\nI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are\nany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between\nplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers\nwould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but\nactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  \n\nLet's kick it off with an example of a player who was \"rushed\", although\nthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the\nnext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\nand has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\n\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

Thus,\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\n\n\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\nThus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\nthe pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \n\n\n\n\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \n\n\n\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\nwould win.\n \nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\ngoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\n\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \npitcher?  They were probably about the same.","target":2}

The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.

Hopefully with the coaches stress on\nsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower\nthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and\nLankford and Zeile's off year).\n\nI don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the \nFilly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  \nGive the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games \nand we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching \nstaff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the\ndifference.\n\nOn a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some \nbaseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked \nwhere to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied \"Fair.\"  I \nremember it being in the \"They Said It\" section of Sports Illustrated.\nI would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.\n\nGO REDBIRDS!!","target":2}

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\nare challenging?\n     \"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\" announced\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to\nwin.\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1\/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  \"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don't see why we can't win this\ndivision.\"\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\npitcher's park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't\nDavis will get decked once.\"\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It's as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     \"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\n     \"We're mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\nplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\nguess that's why they're so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\n     Standings after these weekend series:\nA.L.East\nTeam                     W           L           GB\nNew York                68        42          --\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\nDetroit                 64        46           4\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\nWashington              39         73          28\n\nA.L.West\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\nMinnesota               61         48            1\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\nCalifornia              57         56            8\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\n\nN.L.East\nChicago          57         53                --\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\nNew York         48         64               10\n\nN.L.West\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\nHouston          50          61               17.5\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5","target":2}

{"text":"\nNot particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably\nmore valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he\n*was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty\ncanal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more\nthan *because of* him.\n\n\nUmm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,\nwhere the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure\nof better. The concept is called \"context\", and you should really become\nfamiliar with it someday.\n\n\nUnless this transaltes to \"Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with\na large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to\nthe Jays,\" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.\n\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs\/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n\nSpeaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to\nyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on the\naccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that\na racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your\ncontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to\nany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have\nspent a few too many games in goal without a mask.\n\n\nNo one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win\nat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why? Did Morris somehow \"learn how to win\" in the intervening ten years?\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\na run lower than 1992?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com","target":2}

I just don't understand why people insist\non lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).\nMost batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have\nthe platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.\nI guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams\nmay be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably\nonly a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters\nfor this reason during the regular season.\n\nI think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of\nwhether they are lefties or righties.

At least, to me.\n     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team\nwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real\norder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but\nwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)\nOr a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,\nMays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.\n     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by\nseasons' end.

I would rather have the untried\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\nhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\n\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\n.220.

{"text":"Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and\npredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse\nfinishes in last year's prediction contest.\n\nAL East -- 1993\n\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\nthis:\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\n  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\n  -- Indians aren't ready to contend\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better\n  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\n\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\nof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don't really think that Brady\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\nDavis?  That's insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\n  caught stealing.\n\n2. New York Yankees.\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\n  win a division.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.\n\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\n  have a losing record.\n\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.\n\n5.  Cleveland Indians\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\n  Fermin.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\n\n6.  Boston Red Sox\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how\n  you will :->\n\n7.  Detroit Tigers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker\nWEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.\n  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.\n  This year could be *very* ugly.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.\nObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.\n\nOne more division to go....\n-- \nDale J.

{"text":"\n     The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux\ndid not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight\nfastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the\nfirst one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd,\nwhen Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally\nwalk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.\n\n     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has\nnot scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning\nabout his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he\nhas to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.\n\n\n\n     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba\nhas done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher\nfrom last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.

{"text":" \n\n\n\nTed, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\nto play a three-on-three game.

{"text":"\nWell, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of\nyour predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more\nmeasured. Be that as it may....\n\nClemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond\nwhat might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are\nresponding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely\nsuspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give\nEasler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.\n\nThis was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown\nmuch power yet, though.\n\nHow can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's\nCalderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing\nthose people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe\nit's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as\nwell as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.\n\nIn three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?\n\nA bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that\nZupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of\nsmall sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd\nbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware\nthat his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as\nlong as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.\n\nUmmm...sorry, no. I can buy the \"in the field\" part, and I think he'll be\nbetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll\nbe a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little\nluck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,\nVentura, and Palmer will all be better).\n\n\nSee, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500\nis plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \"could run away with\nthe division\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white\ncoats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If\nRussell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch\njust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could\nbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too\nstupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas\ncontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a\nlefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com","target":2}
{"text":"\nYou're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia,\nand I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially\nif that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's\naway at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,\nthen Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed\nColeman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two\nseperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2.

And it isn't because I loathe the Philly\nsports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite\nAL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:\n\n\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\n\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\n\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\n \t  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on\n\t  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\n\t  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\n\t  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score\n\t  being reported on WIP.\n\n\t2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\n\t  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\n\t  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\n\t  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\n\t  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.","target":2}

{"text":"\nI am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling\nor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.\nHowever, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \n\nIMHO \nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\nthink it deserves some consideration.\n\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\n\nDarrell Evans - No.\n\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\n\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\n\n\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\n\n\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\nmaking a case for him. \n\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\nbring up his name.\n\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\nprobably will turn into a definately.\n\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\nthe possible votes.\n\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\n\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\n\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.","target":2}

{"text":"\nYes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we\nhave lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our\ndecisions on.\n\nI might as well say \"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet\ntall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\"\n\n\nWhy isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after\nadjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an\nabsolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.\n\nAs for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the\nminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't\nbelieve there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good\nseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent\nseason?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to\nuse.\n\n\nThe point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he\nhadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager\nto question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him\ndown \"until he gets warmed up\".\n\n\nMost players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do\nwith Javy Lopez?\n\n\nSee above.  \n\n\nBut I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most\nplayers aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year\neither.\n\n\nAnd demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.\n\n\nNot superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're\nbeing charitable.\n\n\nUmmm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year\nin his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a\nbig question mark.  The Bream\/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and\nhas rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable\nbat... for a shortstop.\n\n\n\nWanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson\/Berryhill could be\n20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player\nwith experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.\n\n\nJust like Keith Mitchell did?\n\n\nThat was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\nreally don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\nor some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more\nflattering to the organization.\n\n\n[Well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted.]\n\n","target":2}

Stats like \"plus\/minus\" make RBI look good.\n\n\nOK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which\nI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\n\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com","target":2}

[*]\n\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope\nof 1\/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).\n\nI've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\n\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I'm\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\n\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\nshape?\n\nCurrently I take:\n\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nand produce:\n            \n             1  2  3  4\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\n                                    61 62 63 64\n\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\nit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\nalready skewed?\n\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\n\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\na real perspective drawing.\n\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n","target":1}

{"text":"\n\nI agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.\n\nThe original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and\nbetter) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,\nand (2) that DEC did.\n\nOn statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer\ncompanies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market\nposition\/share).

{"text":"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\n\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\ncan help a little.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are\noff-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,\nbeing targeted directly at the VR application developer.

{"text":"\nIt helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can't allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

{"text":"\nOpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable\ninterface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\n\n\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\nshot.\n\n\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\n1988 and grew to include the 4D\/20, 4D\/25, 4D\/30 and 4D\/35 as clock rates\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI\n('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power\nSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\n18 months to 2 years.\n\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I\/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\ndon't, we become uncompetitive.\n\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\nfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\n\n\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\ncustomer base.\n\n\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\ncommitments.\n\n\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\n\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,\nwe know it.\n\nJosh   |:-)\n\n-- \n","target":1}

Contact your sysadmin\nfor more info).\n\nThese 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in\nmany places (see below)\n\n--\n\nMany FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site\npit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory\npub\/usenet\/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears\nin the Archive-name line at the top of the article.\nThis FAQ is archived as graphics\/resources-list\/part[1-3]\n\nThere's a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to\nmail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field\n\n--\n\nThe inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the\nSubject 4: Mail servers )\n\n--\n\nThe Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine\nenuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list.\nIt's got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of\nindexing.\n\n--\n\nAnother place that monitors the Listing is the MaasInfo files.\nFor more info contact Robert E.

It's appreciated that you will use Archie\nbefore asking help in the newsgroups.\n\nArchie servers:\n  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie\/NZ)\n  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland\/Eur.)\n  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)\n  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)\n  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)\n  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)\n  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)\n  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK\/Ireland)\n  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])\n  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])\n  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])\n  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])\n  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)\n\nConnect to Archie server with telnet and type \"archie\" as username.\nTo get help type 'help'.\nYou can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie\nwithout the burden of a telnet session.\n'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,\nvol. 27.\n\nTo get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with\nsubject \"help\" to \"archie\" account at any of above sites.\n\n(Note to Janet\/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is\naccessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].\nConnect to it and specify \"archie\" as the host name and \"archie\" as\nthe username.)\n\n==========================================================================\n\n2. Notes\n========\n(Excerpted from the FAQ article)\n\nPlease do *not* post or mail messages saying \"I can't FTP, could\nsomeone mail this to me?\"  There are a number of automated mail servers\nthat will send you things like this in response to a message.\n\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix\/fbm\",\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n3.

{"text":"Hi there,\n\nI've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally\nwrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone\nhere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but\nare missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an\nintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.\n\n*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it\n*** for a 286.

They\nare fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,\nanyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a\n\"virtual screen\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with\nno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy\nareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a\nsimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256\ncolor GIF image into a buffer.

{"text":"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\nSince he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\n\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes\/reads aren't performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I\/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?\n","target":1}

{"text":"\n\n\n\nRather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which\nprogramming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.\n\nI wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences\nbetween PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out\npretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...\n\nPHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many\ndevices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take\nadvantage of a 3D extension to X called \"PEX\".  PEXlib is a slightly\n\"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\nextension to X.\n\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\n- Is free of \"policy\"\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\n\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection\/creation.\n\nIf you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that\nboth API's have a lot in common.","target":1}

Plotting packages\n=====================\n\nGnuplot 3.2\n-----------\n  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with\n  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility\n  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).\n  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers\n  and is easily extensible to include new devices.\n  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.\n  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).\n  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.\n\nXvgr and Xmgr (ACE\/gr)\n-----------------------\n  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using\n  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for\n  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE\/gr.\n  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1\n  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3\/Motif 1.0x.\n\n  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in\n  \/CCALMR\/pub\/acegr\/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)\n  \/CCALMR\/pub\/acegr\/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)\n\n  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner\n  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).\n  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.\n\nRobot\n-----\n  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written\n  in C \/ Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).\n  Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at\n  ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28),  pub\/astrod.\n\nVG plotting library\n-------------------\n  This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov\n  [129.6.64.151]\n\nXgobi\n-----\n  It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are\n  multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it\n  from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena\n  widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge\n  from STATLIB at CMU.\n  To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and\n  in the body area of the message, put the line\n\n  send xgobi from general\n\n  If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu.

Added\n+  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,\n+  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.\n+  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the\n+  plotting area for zooming-in.

Despite its small size and quickness,\n+  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:\n+  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,\n+  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or\n+  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n+  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n+  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n+  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n+  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n+  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n+  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n+  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n+  \n+  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n+  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub\/plplot\n+  \n+  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n+  \n+  Unix:   SunOS, A\/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG\/UX, Ultrix\n+  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga\/Exec, MS-DOS, OS\/2, NeXT\n+  \n+  Authors: Many.

Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR\/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits\/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\n\nPhotoMac\n--------\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\n\nPhotoPress\n----------\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\n\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\n------------------------\n  \"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue\/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF\/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don't know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\n\nDigital Darkroom\n----------------\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\n\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

The tool has over 80 mathematical filter\n  variations: \"Laplacian, medium noise filter\", etc.  Files can be saved\n  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).\n\n  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109\n\nImage Analyst\n-------------\n  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative\n  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor\/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows\/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS\/6000, Dec\/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000\/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display\"\n\nHIPS\n----\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)\n\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386\/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome\/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads\/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image\/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - \/ * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - \/ *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1\/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper\/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions\/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,\n   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\n   any specified angle.\no  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over\/underscan\n   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to\n   region target mean, median, or modal value.\no  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,\n   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.\no  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of\n   region of an image.\no  review\/change image information\/header data, rename keywords, plot\n   keyword values for a set of images.\no  luminance\/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,\n   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower\n   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

{"text":"\n[ description of experiment deleted ]\n\n\n[ more deleted ]\n\n\nA few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from\na 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels\nsynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After\nexperimenting with different aperture settings and screen\nbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable\ncontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no\nvisible contrast bands.\n\nTo minimize the exposure time the display program built 255\ndifferent 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels\nthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,\netc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was\nvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these\nframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera\nshutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote\ndirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.\n\nOur biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the\ntop left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took\nan extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the\nprocessors took the trouble to manually move the all images into\nthe center of the print. Who'd have guessed?","target":1}

{"text":"\nBasically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,\noutside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In\nthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point\nof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,\nthen it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which\nmay make you headache.\n\nThe second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and\nall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the\nsuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then\nit is on the polygon.

{"text":"About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \nsolutions to it.\n\n\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \nthe object we \n\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\n\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\n\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\n\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\n\tmeasure.\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\n\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\n\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\n3) Depth sort the triangles\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\n\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\n\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\n\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\n\n\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\narea.","target":1}

{"text":"-------------------------------------\n\t+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +      \n\t+ \"The Operative Term Is STIMULATE\" + \n\t-------------------------------------\n\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\n\n\nWHAT IS OTIS?\n\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\n\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\ncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...\nthat's what they're here for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE?             \n\nOTIS currently (as of 4\/21\/93) has two FTP sites.  \n \n \t141.214.4.135 (projects\/otis), the UWI site\n\t\t\n\tsunsite.unc.edu (\/pub\/multimedia\/pictures\/OTIS), the SUNsite \n\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\n\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\nappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\ncommand to make sure you're in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB\/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc\/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04\/21\/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you'd like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat's about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n \t     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,\n\t     or ezine administrator.

{"text":"\n\nHere at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film\nsystem (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.\n\nIf you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:\n\nFor the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A\/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.

Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG\/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder\/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code \/ small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+\/-0.25 (instead of +\/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...\n","target":1}

However, expressing\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n    exceed their technical skills.\n\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\n\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n    composing imagery for understanding.\n\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\n    computer graphics context.\n\n\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\n\n        Psychology\/Perception:\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\n            Beverly J.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time\/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits\/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits\/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"\/\"medium\"\/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet\/news.answers\/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet\/news.answers\/ftp-list\/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nJohn Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\nGIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on\nexport or the 'pub\/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\ninternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\ndisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\nbe blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib\/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS\/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub\/jpeg\/viewers\/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386\/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG\/GIF\/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos\/graphics\/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS\/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning\/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/gif\/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/alch161.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos\/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"\/pub\/msdos\/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file \/pub\/bryanw\/pc\/jpeg\/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos\/windows3\/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS\/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check \/pub\/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n\/pub\/os2\/all\/graphics\/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS\/2 1.x.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/imgarc11.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion\/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS\/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmview84.zip\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG\/GIF\/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11\/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT\/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT\/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer\/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT\/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/art\/gif\/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG\/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/qt.1.0.stuff\/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer\/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/app\/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under \/mirrors\/amiga.physik.unizh.ch\/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer\/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/edit\/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga\/os30\/gfx\/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG\/ILBM\/GIF\/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/show\/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga\/gfx\/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file \/atari\/Graphics\/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read\/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory \/graphics\/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)

To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n\/pub\/usenet\/news.answers\/compression-faq\/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF\/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF\/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF\/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression\/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression\/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1\/2 or 1\/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1\/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n","target":1}

This\n       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal\n       and vertical directions.\n       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.\n       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.\n\n                     CONTROLLER VS52\n\n       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM\n       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was\n       created on the base of modern elements, including user\n       programmable gate arrays.\n       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different\n       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change\n       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any\n       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning\n       devices).\n       The controller has the following technical characteristics:\n       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;\n       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64\n       to 1024x512 pixels ;\n       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024\n       pixels;\n       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.\n       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024\n       pixels ;\n       - number of gray level - 256 ;\n       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;\n       - 4 input video multiplexer ;\n       - input\/output lookup table (LUT);\n       - possibility to realize \"scroll\" and \"zoom\";\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external\n       controlling signal) ;\n       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -\n       digital converter;\n       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.\n       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the\n       controller by reprogramming it.\n\n\n              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100\n","target":1}

Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it\"\n\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines\/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\n\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A\/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments\/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\n  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\n\nMicrostation Imager\n-------------------\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\n  software\/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS\/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram\/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes\/groups\/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I\/O\" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application\/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from\/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I\/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould\/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\n  applications\/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac\/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land\/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc\/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub\/sgi\/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing","target":1}

THIS VERSION\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \nto contact me.\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\n\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\n\n********\n\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\n-------------------------------------\n\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \n\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \nof three-dimensional molecules?\n\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \nactually doing it?\n\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \ndo with this package???' , read on.\n\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal\/C library that provides you with simple routines \nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\n\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\nline\/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\n\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\nwhat it all means later on). \n\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\n\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \n\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\ngraphics and how to use the package.\n\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\n\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

{"text":"Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database\nformat used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores\nthe points of a polygon in CCW order.

{"text":"Hi everyone,\n\nI thought that some people may be interested in my VR\nsoftware on these groups:\n\n*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******\n\nMultiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality\nsystem, primarily focused on entertainment\/research.\n\nFeatures:\n\n   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.\n   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).\n   Generic clients.\n   Customizable servers.\n   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).\n   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).\n   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily\n        attached.\n\nFunctionality:\n\n  Client:\n   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n   other users.\n\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\n\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\n\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\n\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\n\n    o User Interface Panels\n\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\n\tfaster frame rates)\n\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\n\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\n\n  Server(s):\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\n\n    o Transparent Client Management\n\n    o Client Message Handling\n\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\naccepting and\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\napplication writer\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\n\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\n\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\n        initialisers you want.\n\n    o Event Handler Registration:\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\n\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\n\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\n    from which to choose.\n\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\n\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\n        any initialization you want to do.\n\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\n\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\n\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\n\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\n\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\n    three world servers I've provided:\n\n        generic - 81 lines\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\n                           versions)\n        dogfight - 72 lines\n\nLocation:\n\n   This software is located at the following site:\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\n\n   Directory:\n   pub\/virtual-worlds\n\n   File:\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\n\nFutures:\n\n   Client:\n\n    o Texture mapping.\n\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\n\n    o HMD support.\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Server:\n\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\n\n    o Enhanced Object Management\/Interaction\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Both:\n\n    o Improved Comms!!!\n\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\nsoftware,\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\n\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\n\nFinally one major disclaimer:\n\nThis is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code\nother than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure\ndesperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad\nthat may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nDisclaimer over!\n\nOf course if you love it, I would like to here from you.

{"text":"\nI certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works\nvery well.  That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it\nbecause of its complexity.\n\nThis complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making\nsome very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF\nimages (though they'll save them, of course), and a general\ninability to interchange images between different environments\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\n\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\nemphasis mine):\n\n\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\nimage-generating applications out there now.\"\n\n\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF\nimage, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to\ndeal with.

{"text":"Printer model and specification:\n\nCanon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)\nps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)\n\n\nHello,\n\nWe have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier\/printer. \nWe want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The \ncopier\/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\nprinter with the \"lp\" system using the parallel interface and can print \npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\nand translating the image into postscript.\n\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \nsome assurance that the product will work.\n\n\nHere my questions:\n\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\n\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the\nlimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on \nthe printer?\n \nThe Big question:\n\nWhere can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?\n\n\n\nPlease email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis. \nI will post a summary.\n\nThanks in advance.\n","target":1}

However, it is unlikely\nthat the object is placed so conveniently.  \n\nFirstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot\nknow what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that\nthey are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?\n\nSecondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar\n(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the\nscreen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?\n\nSo, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the\nimage so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how\ndo I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?\n\nWe'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.\n\nThanks in advance, Simon.","target":1}

{"text":"\nIt should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would\never get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this\nwas mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being\nlikely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either\nconfused, or less than honest\/ethical, or somebody further up the\nchain inside SGI was misleading them.\n\n\nThere were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came\nout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1\/2 years.  The\nchassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was\na pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and\nage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in\nthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over\nits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.\n\n\nPlease, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support\nor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\nbut that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you\nare referring to).\n\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\nsystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\n\n\nThey don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly\nthey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions\nmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in the\nindustry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we\nwon't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we\ndon't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).\n\n\nBut surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year\nperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year\nperiod?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience\n(with workstations\/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available,\nyes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!\n\n\nI missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your\nfrustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might\nhave an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't\ngoing to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we \nhear similar things from more than one person\/site).\n\nAll of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI's.","target":1}

{"text":"I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\nby a 3D scanline renderer. \n\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\nhave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\n\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even\/odd or non-winding rules to\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\n\n\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\n\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\n\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\n\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\n\n\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\n\t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\n\t\tsome fancy fonts).\n\t2) It does not properly handle the even\/odd or non-winding rules.\n\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\n\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\n\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\nbevelled and\/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\nsubjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.\n\nThanks for any pointers.\n\n--> Rob Lansdale\n","target":1}

Perhaps you didn't read the\nfew docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients\nonly, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see\nanything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't\nsee anything there, then this is definitely a problem!\n\nOne final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.\nIf you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for\nany money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,\nmaybe that will get results??","target":1}

{"text":"Hi! Everyone,\n\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\nmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:\n\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were\/will be discarded? And most\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are\/will be used?\n\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\n\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\n\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\nsummary of the answers).","target":1}

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image.

{"text":"Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some\nhelp with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit\/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit\/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit\/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit\/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits\/pixel in the memory.  It's not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\ngetting 6 bit\/pixel (or even 8 bit\/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\n\nThanks.","target":1}
